# Geckboard Test

## Possible approaches

I've made the assumption that we want the chart to be an SVG. This gives us scalable charts that are crisp on any
display density or medium.

After some thinking I came up with 3 possible ways to generate an SVG chart.

 * Use d3 or similar library to generate the chart on the fly in the browser
 * Create an SVG manually and tweak it with code in the browser
 * Use Illustrator/Inkscape to create the image and just CSS transform the indicator

Using d3 feels like the obvious choice as it provides us with lots of tools if we decide to create more complex charts
in future or add interactive features. It is also the most heavy-weight.

This feels a little like reinventing the wheel but it could allow us to easily generate the graph on the server if we
want to later without using tools like PhantomJS or JSDOM.

Using an SVG generated by a tool is probably the fastest way to get just this chart done. If it was a real world project
and we didn't want more charts in future, I'd almost certainly pick this. To achieve the same effect as in the
suggested image, we could cheat and use the indicator to block out the section of the curve.

### TDD

TDD for the chart itself becomes hard. The most sensible approach would be to test just the text and perhaps the angle
of the indicator. We probably don't want to mock lots of the d3 API. It probably doesn't make much sense to test an
image either.

Later on we could use regression testing with PhantomCSS or Wraith to make sure the chart is drawn correctly.
